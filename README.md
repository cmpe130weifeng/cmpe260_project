Use RPS_Claasifier.ipynb to train the model, and save the model for later usage. 
</br>
</br>
For training the model, you can download the dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanikamal/rock-paper-scissors-dataset </br>
</br>
Change the path of model in RPSgame.py,
checkpoint = torch.load('C:/Users/ray/Downloads/checkpoint.pth')

```
checkpoint = torch.load('C:/Users/ray/Downloads/checkpoint.pth')
```
