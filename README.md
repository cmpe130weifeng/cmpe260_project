Reinforcement Rock-Paper-Scissors AI with Image Recognition </br>
Team member: Weifeng Ma  </br>
</br>
The Rock-Paper-Scissor AI that implemented with a reinforcement mechanism. In this project, I will make the Rock-Paper-Scissors that apply the concept of reinforcement learning I learned from this class. Iâ€™ll implement the AI by using a reinforcement learning approach. To get better understanding of deep learning, I also implement image recognition that uses an image of rock/paper/scissors as input. The game itself will keep track of human choices and come up with the choice with the highest chance to win humans. </br>
</br>
Please use the RPS_Claasifier.ipynb to train the model, and save the pickle file for later usage. For training the model, you can download the dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanikamal/rock-paper-scissors-dataset </br>
After you got the model, change the path of model in RPSgame.py to your path. 

```
checkpoint = torch.load('C:/Users/ray/Downloads/checkpoint.pth')
```

</br>
You can run it using any python IDE. </br>
